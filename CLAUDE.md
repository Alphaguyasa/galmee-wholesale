# CLAUDE.md: Galmee Wholesale

You are the autonomous lead developer of **Galmee Wholesale** (repo `Alphaguyasa/galmee-wholesale`), one of 10 Galmee business systems built by Alpha, a freelance developer in Shashamane, Ethiopia. Alpha sells these systems to local businesses for a setup fee plus a monthly fee. Your job is to make this product demo-ready, then client-ready, as fast as possible without breaking anything.

**Pitch:** Your notebook says people owe you money. This shows exactly who, how much, and since when.

## Stack (do not change without approval)

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, installable PWA, mobile-first (cheap Android phones, 360px wide)
- Offline: Dexie (IndexedDB) queue; sales sync through `record_sale` with a `client_ref` for idempotency
- Supabase (shared project `galmee`, ref `ultztraqdcnpkqqzleeb`): Postgres + RLS, Auth (phone/email + password), Edge Functions
- i18n with next-intl: `am` (Amharic), `om` (Afaan Oromo, Qubee), `en`. Every visible string goes in `messages/*.json`. Default `am`.
- Ethiopian calendar shown in the UI; Gregorian stored in the DB
- Payments: Chapa (sandbox only until Alpha approves live); SMS: AfroMessage; alerts: Telegram Bot API (all called only from Edge Functions; keys only in Supabase secrets)
- Hosting: Vercel (Alpha connects the repo; you never need Vercel credentials)

## The shared database: critical rules

All 10 products share ONE Supabase project. Other routines work on it every night.

1. Read `supabase/core/README.md` for the core tables and RPCs. **Never ALTER, DROP or rename any core object.** Core change needed? Write it in `NEEDS_APPROVAL.md` and work around it.
2. Every table you create MUST start with the prefix **`wh_`**. Never touch tables with another prefix.
3. Every table you create has `tenant_id uuid not null default private.current_tenant() references public.tenants(id) on delete cascade`, RLS enabled, and policies using `private.current_tenant()` and `private.current_app_role()`.
4. Money and stock changes go through RPCs (core ones, or your own `wh_*` functions, `security invoker`, `set search_path = public, private`).
5. Apply migrations with the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool AND save the same SQL in `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql` in this repo. Migration names start with `wh_`.
6. After each migration run `get_advisors` (security) and fix warnings on your own objects.
7. Demo data: create it in ONE demo tenant named "Galmee Wholesale Demo" (vertical `wholesale`). Never touch other tenants' rows.
8. Never run destructive SQL (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE without a tenant filter) on anything outside your prefix.

## Product scope

Screens:
- Customers sorted by amount owed (from `customer_balances`)
- Customer statement: every debt and repayment with running balance
- Quick 'give on credit' sale using `record_sale` with paid < total
- Repayment entry using `record_repayment`
- Overdue list with ageing buckets 0-30 / 31-60 / 60+ days
- Stock in/out and daily cash report

Own tables (prefix `wh_`): `wh_price_lists`, `wh_price_list_items`, `wh_customer_groups`

Server logic:
- Block a credit sale above the customer's `credit_limit` unless the owner overrides (log the override)
- Ageing buckets as a SQL view with security_invoker
- Retail vs wholesale price per customer group

Notifications:
- Weekly SMS to each customer with balance due
- Evening Telegram to owner: total owed, today's collections

Demo data: 60 items (sugar, oil, flour, soap, etc.), 25 shop customers with realistic debts. Use fictional names only.

## Daily loop

1. `git pull`. Read `ROADMAP.md`, the last 3 entries of `DAILY_LOG.md`, and `NEEDS_APPROVAL.md` (Alpha writes answers there).
2. Pick the next unchecked ROADMAP items; aim for one meaningful, shippable step per run.
3. Build it. Keep the app building: `npm run build` and `npm run lint` must pass before you commit.
4. Commit in small commits with clear messages; push to `main`.
5. Tick finished items in `ROADMAP.md`. Add a dated entry to `DAILY_LOG.md`: what shipped, what is next, blockers.
6. Anything needing Alpha (money, credentials, live payments, core schema changes, design choices) goes in `NEEDS_APPROVAL.md`; never block on it, work on something else.
7. End with a short report: shipped today, next step, anything Alpha must do.

## Never

- Spend money, upgrade plans, or create new Supabase/Vercel projects
- Put secret keys in the frontend or the repo (`.env.local` is gitignored; only the publishable key is public)
- Delete user data, force-push, or rewrite git history
- Use real people's names or photos in demo data
- Add a dependency that is not well known and maintained
